# Functional-Peptide-Discovery
A number of interactive scripts developed for digging natural active peptides based on the jupyter environment. 
The scripts enable hydrolysis and bioactivity assessment of large batches of protein sequences, evaluation and collation of large batches of hydrolysed peptides for their AMDET properties. It also enables machine learning based QSAR studies and fast calculation of CHA and CCA scores of pharmacophore developed on Pharmit server. These scripts facilitate rapid prediction of pharmacokinetic properties, antioxidant activity and anti-tyrosinase activity of large batches of natural protein hydrolysates.
