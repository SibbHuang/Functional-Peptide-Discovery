This script called **Conformers generation and optimization** uses the RDKit module to generate distinct molecular conformations.

##### Package requirements:

Script using only pandas (>=1.1.5) and rdkit ( >= 2021.09) module and basic os  module in Python.

##### Usageï¼š

You just need to run the code blocks in turn to do it. A file called example. csv was provided in the same directory. 

PPCPW.sdf and VVCTY.sdf were the results exported after running the example.csv.

Note that the limited number of conformation of small molecular weight molecules can be generated. For example, kojic_acid.sdf and leonurine.sdf in the same directory did not yield the required number of non-repetitive conformations (100).
